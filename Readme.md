Bank Sample Project
==============================

This project two modules that implement a basic charges list of a bank acount.

One module is the API REST module programmed using Apigility (PHP).

The other module is a client developed with Backbone.

I've divided this project in two modules because client and server usually are stored in diferent machines.

To see more details enter in the Bank-API and Bank-client modules and read their respectives Readme.md file.
